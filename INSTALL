How to install eLogbook
-----------------------

Get a tarball of latest release and unpack:
gtar -xzvf eLogbook-X.X.tar.gz or
tar -xzvf eLogbook-X.X.tar.gz

I. Configure: 
-------------

cd eLogbook-X.X/
./autogen.sh

(see below or use ./autogen --help for options)

II. Make:
---------

make install

The default installation prefix is /usr

Make will create the eLogbook application in /usr/bin/eLogbook
and copy the following configuration files in /usr/share/eLogbook:

1- icon.xpm
the application icon.

2- pixmaps
the application pixmaps directory

III. Local installation:
------------------------

For a local installation use:
./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME

Binaries and resource files will be created in $HOME/bin and
$HOME/share/eLogbook, respectively.

IV. Troubles at configuration:
------------------------------

autogen.sh may possibly complained of not finding the Qt libraries libraries and/or
headers. The default path is assumed to be:

/usr/lib/qt3/lib for libraries
/usr/lib/qt3/include for headers
/usr/lib/qt3/bin for binaries (namely moc, the Qt meta object file generator)

You can tell autogen.sh where to find non default path:

./autogen.sh --with-Qt=[path]

in which case [path]/lib, [path]/include and [path]/bin will be use in place of
the defaults.

You can also explicitely define all path:
using:
./autogen.sh \
  --with-Qt-lib=[lib_path] \
  --with-Qt-include=[include_path] \
  --with-Qt-bin=[bin_path]

Make sure you have all libraries, header for Qt installed on your platform.


V. plugins:
-----------
Other plugins are needed to run all eLogbook utilities. They do not make the
configuration nor the compilation crash. The corresponding tools are however 
disabled.

A text editor: default is nedit
A web browser: default is konqueror
A ps viewer: default is gv.

Alternate applications can be specified in the resource file.

VI. interface to aspell:
------------------------
eLogbook has been interfaced to aspell for spell checking.
Only recent versions of aspell will work. Aspell is checked at configuration file.
Configure.in will look for the files

/usr/lib/libaspell.so
/usr/include/aspell.h

Alternative path names can be specified using 
./autogen.sh \
  --with-aspell-lib=[lib_path] \
  --with-aspell-include=[include_path]

Finally, the aspell command line executable will also be used.
It's path must be in your $PATH environment variable so that it gets found 
at configuration time.

Note: the application will still work without a proper aspell installation on your system.
However the spell checking functionality will be disabled.
